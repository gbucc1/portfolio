	Hello, my name is Giacomo and I am a grade 12 student at A.Y Jackson Secondary School. 
	In our grade 12 computer science class as a final project were required to make a portfolio summarizing
	what we worked on throughout the semester. This website is my portfolio, it contains my top ten modules that
	I worked on in the class. These modules contain different coding languages such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
	There are also a few that contain different computer science principles that I learned. The last module
	is my interpretation of a couple of <a class='link' href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Shiffman's</a>
	creative coding challenges. 
	There is also a link to my GitHub on the left that contains all the code I used to create this website.
	</p>
