	<h1 class='changeColor'> My Top Ten Modules </h1>
	<p> 
	On this page I will be explaining my top ten favorite modules I worked on during the course. 
	I am hoping to do cyber security work after high school so many of these modules were chosen for that. 
	</p>
	<h1> Intro to JS </h1>
	<p>
	The intro to JS course on Khan Academy was a perfect way to start coding. It taught me simple thinks like drawing shapes and all the basics of JavaScript.
	It was a great stepping stone for more advanced coding. 
	</p>
	<h1> Intro to HTML/CSS </h1>
	<p>
	The intro to HTML/CSS course was a great introduction to the world of creating websites. Knowing HTML and CSS is a very important step if you
	want to pursue a career in computers. This course was simple enough for a completely new coder to understand and it tought me a lot.
	</p>
	<h1> Advanced Games and Visualizations </h1>
	<p>
	This advanced JavaScript course expanded the intro to JS course by showing many more complicated ways of using JavaScript to make games and animations.
	I used the skills I learned in the intro to JS course to follow along and it helped me understand more advanced concepts in coding. 
	</p>
	<h1> Natural Simulations </h1>
	<p>
	This course is another more advanced course compared to the intro to JS course. It built upon the last course in order to use more difficult concepts
	such as randomness, probability and vectors. 
	</p>
	<h1> CSP: Programming </h1>
	<p>
	This course went over all the main concepts involved in coding such as variables and pseudocode. These are the very basics and they help you understand 
	coding as a whole, regardless of the language. 
	</p>
	<h1> CSP: Online Data Security </h1>
	<p>
	The online data security course explained many different ways that hackers can break into your accounts and devices. Understanding that makes
	it easier for you to defend yourself online. This course is very important for me since I want to go into cyber security. 
	</p>
	<h1> CSP: The Internet </h1>
	<p>
	This course explained how the internet really works. It explains concepts like packets, networks and connections. This is another course that is 
	perfect for cyber security.
	</p>
	<h1> CSP: Digital Information </h1>
	<p>
	The digital information course went very in depth about different file sizes and data types. The course also explained binary code and digital 
	copyright laws. This course helped me understand computers better as a whole, which will help me advance my computer science knowledge. 
	</p>
	<h1> CSP: Algorithms </h1>
	<p>
	The algorithms course explained different ways of computing and how algorithms tie into real world scenarios. The course went really in depth on 
	parallel computing, which is when a computer breaks down larger problems into multiple smaller problems in order to solve them more efficiently. 
	This is an essential part of how our computers work and it helped me understand more of how computers function.
	</p>
	<h1> Creative Coding Sessions </h1>
	<p>
	In this module I learned to code in a more object-oriented way. I had to follow a coding challenge given by The Coding Train and recreate it. 
	I also listened to my peers presentations and modified their code. You can find all of the code in the <a class='link' href="projects.html">Projects tab.</a>
